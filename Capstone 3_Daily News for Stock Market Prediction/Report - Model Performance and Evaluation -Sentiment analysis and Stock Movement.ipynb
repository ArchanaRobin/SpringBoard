    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It is in the interest of many people and companies to predict the price movement and direction of the stock market. Also, the stock market is a vital component of a country’s economy. It is one of the most significant opportunities for investment by companies and investors. Stock traders need to predict trends in the stock market to determine when to sell or buy a stock. To see profits, stock traders need to acquire those stocks whose prices are expected to rise shortly and sell those stocks whose prices are expected to decline. If traders can adequately predict the stock trends and patterns, they can earn a considerable profit margin. However, stock markets are very volatile and, consequently, difficult to predict. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stock prices tick up and down constantly due to fluctuations in supply and demand. The relationship between supply and demand is highly sensitive to the news of the moment. Chasing the news is not a good stock-picking strategy for the individual investor. But professional traders react in anticipation of an event. Government economic reports are always news, as they suggest the strength or weakness of the economy, the consumer, and key industry sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative news will normally cause people to sell stocks. Positive news will normally cause individuals to buy stocks. professional traders and manipulators use a number of sources of information like Government economic reports, Company and industry news, and Gossips. \n",
    "\n",
    "Professional traders spend much of their time trying to anticipate the next news cycle so that they can buy or sell stocks before the real numbers are released. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several TV channels today that track the live movement of the stocks throughout the day. The channels also provide information about various stocks from a sector and their speculation. Coverage of economic events that might affect market returns, like recessions, fluctuates over time.\n",

    "### Conclusions and Further Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In our work, we predict the future movement of the United States’ stock market by analyzing the sentiment of news headlines  related to the Stock market. To do this, we collected stock-related news and obtained their average sentiment value by using LSTM, IF-IDF, Word2Vec, and RF. After that, we prepared the training set with those news and with corresponding DJIA Adjusted closing price. closing stock index differences between the present-day and next day. Then we tested on similar stock related news on a different timeline to see how much we can predict the stock index.\n",
    "\n",
    "We were able to derive answers for both of our hypotheses. From the results of our work, it is seen that news do play a role in the prediction of stock market movement. Furthermore, it is implied that Neural Networks perform better than Machine Learning.  Neural Network model has a lower MAE and RMSE than the Machine Learning model. Using a data range of more than one year may provide more accurate results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Future work regarding this study would include using the models on different stock markets across the world. Additionally, analyzing the models in different economic situations such as booms or recession may allow us to better see the productivity of the models. Besides, the use of a neural network for classifying the sentimental analysis news may offer better results."
