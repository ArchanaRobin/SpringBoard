    "Stemming and Lemmatizing is the process of reducing a word to its root form. The main purpose is to reduce variations of the same word, thereby reducing the corpus of words we include in the model. The difference between stemming and lemmatizing is that, stemming chops off the end of the word without taking into consideration the context of the word. Whereas, Lemmatizing considers the context of the word and shortens the word into its root form based on the dictionary definition. Stemming is a faster process compared to Lemmantizing. Hence, it a trade-off between speed and accuracy.\n",
