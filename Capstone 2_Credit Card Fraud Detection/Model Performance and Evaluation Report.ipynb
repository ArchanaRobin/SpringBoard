    "One major challenge credit card companies face year after year is to identify fraudulent transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many controls have been implemented to address this issue. However, most solutions add additional burdens to the customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to address this complex problem by implementing machine learning models to identify fraudulent transactions based on usersâ€™ behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "We present a synthetic dataset generated using the simulator called PaySim as an approach to such a problem. The dataset is highly imbalanced. Here We applied Various algorithms. In this case 1 step is 1 hour of time. Total steps 744 (30 days simulation)."
